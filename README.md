# RC Autopilot

Arduino code for an RC airplane that the kids in my Applied Science Club built. This code was written by me as demo code for them. It implements principles of vector calculus, such as the projection of a point onto a plane, and taking the cross product and dot product of vectors. Here are some pictures of the airplanes that they made:
